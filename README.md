# Arch Install Log – My DevOps Learning Journey

This repo documents my attempt to install and configure Arch Linux from scratch on my personal laptop.

It's my 4th try, and this time I'm doing it right: tracking what I do, what breaks, what works, and what I learn along the way.

## Why I'm Doing This
- To build real troubleshooting muscle
- To understand Linux systems deeply
- To learn in public as I move into a DevOps role

## What You'll Find Here
- `install-log.md`: Day-by-day breakdown of my install and setup process
- Commands, configs, and errors with fixes
- Notes on things I didn't understand until I broke them

## Who This Is For
- Me, to refer back to when I inevitably forget something
- Curious future teammates or hiring managers who want to see how I think

---

No scripts or automation yet — just honest logs. Maybe later I’ll clean it up into a reproducible install process.
